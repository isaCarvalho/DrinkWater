        This application is designated for those who want to live a more healthy life
        and be more hydrated. If you are one of those people, then this application is made for you.
        Here you\'ll find a way to set the amount of water that you want to drink during 24h.
        The app will send you notifications during the day so you\'ll remember to drink it.
        When you drank all of the water that you want in a day, our counter is going to restart
        the counting. If you do not want notifications, then you can go on the \"Notifications\"
        item in the nav and stop it. Please, feel welcome to use this app in you daily life!
